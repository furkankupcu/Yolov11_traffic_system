# YOLOv11-Based Vehicle Behavior Monitorin

This project is an AI-driven application designed to monitor vehicle behavior at pedestrian crossings using YOLOv11. The application detects whether cars:
- Stop for pedestrians at crossings.
- Slow down when approaching crossings.
- Obey traffic lights at intersections.

The system uses computer vision to track vehicles and pedestrians in real-time, making it suitable for traffic monitoring and smart city applications.

## Project Overview
In urban environments, pedestrian safety is a significant concern. This project aims to assist traffic authorities by automating the monitoring of vehicle compliance with pedestrian crossings and traffic light signals.

The system detects vehicles and pedestrians using the YOLOv11 object detection model. It tracks vehicle behavior as they approach pedestrian crossings and intersections, determining if they stop for pedestrians or violate traffic lights.

## Key Features
- **Pedestrian and vehicle detection** using YOLOv11.
- **Behavior analysis** to check if vehicles slow down or stop at crossings.
